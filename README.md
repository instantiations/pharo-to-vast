Little tool to ease exporting code from Pharo to VA Smalltalk

This is an exporter from Pharo source code to Instantiations VA Smalltalk. This exporter can reject explicit classes, extension methods, methods, and generates the resulting Monticello files (.mcz) into a user specified direcotry.  

By default, the exporter will also take care of re-write the Pharo's literal Array that use curly brackets with a way that would work in VA Smalltalk.
